    <p> Cattle are reffered to as either cows or bulls depending on their sex. 
        Male cattle are reffered to as bulls while female cattle are called cows. 
        Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for milk, hides, and meat. They are
        also used as riding animals and draft animals. In addition, their dung is 
        used for fuel.
