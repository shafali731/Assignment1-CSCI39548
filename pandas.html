    <p> The giant panda, or more commonly refered to as panda or panda bear, are 
        native to South Central China. They are best known for their black and white 
        coat and rotund body. Pandas are folivores with bamboo shoots and leaves 
        making up the majority of their diet. In the wild, however, they will 
        occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat.
